Project Overview: **Basic Calculator Program**

# Overview
The Simple Calculator UI is a user-friendly desktop application built using Java Swing. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a graphical user interface (GUI).

# Features
Graphical User Interface: The calculator features a simple and intuitive GUI with clearly labeled input fields and buttons, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations:
  Addition (+)
  Subtraction (-)
  Multiplication (*)
  Division (/)(with error handling for division by zero)

- **Input Validation**: The application includes robust input validation to ensure that users enter valid numbers. If an invalid input is detected, an error message is displayed, guiding the user to correct their input.

- **Real-Time Results**: Once the user inputs the numbers and selects an operation, the result is instantly calculated and displayed within the application window.

- **Error Handling**: The program handles common errors such as division by zero, and invalid number entries, and provides user-friendly error messages to help users understand and correct issues.

# How to Use
Enter Numbers: Input the first and second numbers into the designated text fields.
Select Operation: Click on one of the four operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform the desired calculation.
- **View Result**: The result will be displayed in the lower part of the window.
